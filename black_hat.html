        <p> By classical definition, a black hat hacker is anyone who uses his hacking skills for causing harm or with a malicious nature. A black hat hacker is a criminal, both morally and legally speaking.
            Black hat hackers would use their skills to break open a digital system to steal or misuse data. Such a person would do that for selfish gain.
            Imagine a fully secure bank robbery and they know how to enter the room and steal the money violently or sneakily. They would do that with a handheld device, a laptop, desktop computer, website, databases and any kind of digital entity. Most often a black hat hacker’s crime would not be exposed until they’ve finished the breach.
            Some hackers love ‘showmanship’ or do everything sneakily till they’ve done all they wanted to do.
            So, all in all, a black hat hacker is a criminal that operates mainly online. For this reason most of us are afraid of blackhat hackers every time we use our bank cards somewhere or think twice before entering personal data into any website.
