    <p>Different colors are used to identify hackers and their hacking styles.
        The spectrum begins with white hat hackers, people who break into systems only with the intention of strengthening them. They identify loopholes and cracks and help infrastructure experts correct them.       
        The other end of the spectrum is occupied by black hat hackers. These are the bad guys of the industry, people who break into digital systems solely with negative intention, meaning to cause financial or infrastructural harm.        
        From breaking into bank accounts, to hacking public information, a black hat hacker would break into any system for his own benefit.        
        Just like how the color grey is a lighter tone of the black, a grey hack is a lighter version of a black hack.        
        Grey hat hackers are known for breaking into systems, but they do so without the intention of benefitting their own selves. This implies that a grey hack is a malicious attack into a digital system, that causes no real benefit to the hacker, but exploits data, or causes losses.
