        <h2 align="center">What is a hacker ?</h2>
        <p>The basic definition of a <strong>hacker</strong> is someone who uses a computer system to gain unauthorized access to another system for data or who makes another system unavailable. These hackers will use their skills for a specific goal, such as stealing money, gaining fame by bringing down a computer system, or making a network unavailable -- even sometimes destroying them. However, there are three different types of hackers, each with a particular goal, and not all are the bad guys.</p>
        <h2 align="center"> Difference between white, black and gray hat hackers</h2>
        <p align="center"> Besides white hat, there are two other types of hackers: black hat and gray hat.
            Where white hat hackers disclose all the vulnerabilities they find to the party responsible for the system -- usually, the company or vendor that makes the affected product -- a black hat hacker has no qualms about selling vulnerabilities and exploits to the highest bidder, such as a criminal organization, usually for the purpose of exploiting them. Black hat hackers are willing to break the law to discover, create and use security flaws maliciously for personal gain or to make a political statement.
            Gray hat hackers fall between white and black hats on the moral spectrum. Gray hats generally consider themselves good guys who are more flexible about the rules under which they operate. For example, a gray hat hacker may be more likely than a white hat hacker to access systems without getting permission or authorization from the owners, but would be less likely than a black hat hacker to cause damage to those systems. While not typically motivated by financial gain, gray hat hackers may try to get the owners of a system they've hacked to pay them to patch or fix those systems.</p>
